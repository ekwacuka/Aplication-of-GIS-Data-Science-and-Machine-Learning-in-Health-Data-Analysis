# Application_of_GIS_DataScience_and_Machine_Learning_in_Health_Data_Analysis

Used python for spatial data analysis and machine learning to predict the daily numbers of Covid-19 vaccines to be administered.

The processes involved include:

  - Exprolatory Data analysis using Pandas. 
  - Data visualization using GeoPandas, Folium, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
  - Predictive analysis using Statsmodels and SciKit-Learn.
  

Machine learning models used include:

  - ARIMA
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - XGBoost
